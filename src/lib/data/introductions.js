        history: "Cardano was founded in 2015 by Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), a blockchain research and development company led by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood. It is the first blockchain platform to be built from the ground up through peer-reviewed research and evidence-based methods. The project draws inspiration from academic research in cryptography and distributed systems. Cardano's development is divided into eras, starting with the Byron era (foundation establishment) and progressing through Shelley (decentralization), Goguen (smart contracts), Basho (scaling), and Voltaire (governance).",

Fielding drew from his experience designing the World Wide Web and sought to define the architectural principles that made the web successful. REST emerged as a way to simplify and standardize web service design, contrasting with more complex approaches like SOAP. It gained widespread adoption in the 2000s and 2010s, becoming the dominant architectural style for web APIs, powering services from social media platforms to cloud computing.",
