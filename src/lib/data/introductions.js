It aims to enable positive global change by offering an alternative to traditional financial systems.",
        description: "Discover the future of sustainable blockchain technology with Cardano",
        history: "Cardano was founded in 2015 by Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), a blockchain research and development company led by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood. It is the first blockchain platform to be built from the ground up through peer-reviewed research and evidence-based methods. The project draws inspiration from academic research in cryptography and distributed systems. Cardano's development is divided into eras, starting with the Byron era (foundation establishment) and progressing through Shelley (decentralization), Goguen (smart contracts), Basho (scaling), and Voltaire (governance).",

The CIP process was designed to align with Cardano's commitment to peer-reviewed research, evidence-based development, and decentralized governance. As Cardano progressed through its development eras—from Byron (foundation) through Shelley (decentralization), Goguen (smart contracts), Basho (scaling), and Voltaire (governance)—CIPs became increasingly important for standardizing protocols, ensuring wallet interoperability, and documenting community-driven enhancements.
