		CardanoThings.io is an educational platform for learning about and building Cardano-based IoT
		projects with ESP32-based Microcontrollers and was initially funded by <a
			href="https://projectcatalyst.io/"
			class="link"
			target="_blank">Project Catalyst</a
		> in Fund 11. Our mission is to make people curious about Cardano and the Internet of Things and
		how to connect those two together.

	<h2 class="inline-block text-2xl font-medium md:text-3xl">Philosophy</h2>
	<p class="text-base leading-relaxed font-thin md:text-lg">
		We aim to teach you the very basics of some of the tech needed to build IoT projects and connect
		them to the Cardano blockchain and learn about the Cardano ecosystem while doing so. While our
		examples might sound silly or overly basic at first, we are covering a lot of ground dipping
		into all kind of different concepts and topics from Cardano Libraries, Wallets,
		Microcontrollers, APIs, and more.
	</p>

	<p class="mt-6 text-base leading-relaxed font-thin md:text-lg">
		The goal is not so much to teach you how to build a specific project, but to teach you the very
		basic concepts and (some) skills you will need to come up with and build your own projects -
		with or without Cardano.
	</p>

	<p class="mt-6 text-base leading-relaxed font-thin md:text-lg">
		While these initial <a href="/workshops" class="link">Workshops</a> are mostly aimed at beginners,
		we also hope to help more experienced developers learn something new and expand their knowledge.

	<p class="text-base leading-relaxed font-thin md:text-lg">
		While we started with the initial five <a href="/workshops" class="link">Workshops</a>, which
		are meant to be done in order to get you on your way to building your own projects, we quickly
		realized the need for smaller code examples for specific topics and features and introduced the
		<a href="/blocks" class="link">Building Blocks</a> section. These are meant to be a quick
		reference for specific topics and features as a starting point for your own projects and will be
		updated with more examples over time. Besides that we offer short
		<a href="/introductions" class="link">Introductions</a>
		on specific topics to give you some context and a <a href="/glossary" class="link">Glossary</a> covering
		all the terms you might encounter on this site.
	</p>

	<p class="mt-6 text-base leading-relaxed font-thin md:text-lg">
		If you choose to go through the Workshops, we recommend you to also check out the <a
			href="/hardware"
			class="link">Hardware List</a
		>
		to get an overview of the hardware we use in the examples, where to get it, how to set it up and
		how to use it. Each Workshop has code examples for you to download and use in your own projects and
		various lists of further resources to help you get started. All code examples including this whole
		website built with Svelte are also available on our
		<a href="https://github.com/CardanoThings/" class="link" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.
	</p>

	<p class="mt-6 text-base leading-relaxed font-thin md:text-lg">
		In the future we will also add user projects and examples to the site to give you some
		inspiration and ideas for your own projects.
