        <ul>
          <li>If you don't see any output, check that the correct COM port is selected</li>
          <li>Make sure the baud rate in Serial Monitor matches the one in your code (115200)</li>
          <li>Try pressing the reset button on your ESP32</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Next Steps:</strong> Once you have this working, you can modify the message or change the delay time to experiment with different output patterns.</p>`
